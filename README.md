# Etch-a-Sketch
This is a project that will allow you to draw something on the screen.

I wanted to make this to be a rendition of the real Etch-a-Sketch drawing game that was
popular many years ago. I think it does look like it.

In this project I learned how to add multiple divs using grid and flex, though it was 
grid the  preferred method used.

I tried setting the border and padding of the element to be adjusted depending on the number
entered for the rows and columns. Though the result was not what was expected, an easier way 
was to just decrease the padding to px to an acceptable size for box the defaul 16x16 grid 
and up to 144x144. Values greater than this might not be comfortable as the dots are too 
small and mouse accurracy is needed.

Though I consider the project to be finished, though as with any other project, there's always an opportunity to come back to it and adjust one feature or the other. Some use can be found for the bottons on the side of the sketch, that are for now just decorative.

Overall I'm very happy with the result.
